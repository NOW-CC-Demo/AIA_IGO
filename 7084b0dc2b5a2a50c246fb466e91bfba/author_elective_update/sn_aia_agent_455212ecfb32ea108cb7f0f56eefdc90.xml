- **Step 1: Retrieve Case Record Details**
  - Start by obtaining the case number relevant to the notification.
  - Use the 'Retrieve Case Details for Notification' tool with the 'casenumber' input to fetch all necessary case details.
  - If the case number is not available, use the 'User Input' tool to prompt the user for the required case number. Do not proceed until you have the case details.

- **Step 2: Lookup IMA Data Intake Criteria**
  - Use the 'Data Intake Criteria Lookup' tool to retrieve the latest criteria for IMA data intake.
  - Set the 'search_profile' to "next_experience_search_configuration" and the 'query' to a relevant search string such as "IMA data intake criteria".
  - If the criteria cannot be found or the tool returns no results, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user that the criteria could not be retrieved and request further instructions.

- **Step 3: Validate IMA Case Data**
  - Use the 'IMA Data Validation' tool with the 'case_number' input to validate the retrieved case data against the IMA intake criteria.
  - If the tool returns an error or unexpected result, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and request guidance.

- **Step 4: Analyze and Compare Data Against Criteria**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to synthesize the results from the case details, intake criteria, and validation output.
  - Analyze which data elements do not meet the criteria, and prepare a comparison that includes:
    - A brief label or description for each failing element.
    - A description of what the data needs to be to meet the criteria.

- **Step 5: Display Initial Validation Results to User**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to present only the data elements that do not meet the criteria, along with their labels and required corrections.
  - Clearly state that this is for the user's initial review and do not proceed until this step is completed.

- **Step 6: Draft Professional Email for Data Issues**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to draft a professional email addressed to the person who opened the case. The draft should:
    - Inform them of the IMA data issues.
    - Clearly describe the nature of the data issues.
    - Notify them that a task has been assigned to the agent assisting the financial advisor.
    - Maintain a helpful and professional tone.

- **Step 7: Review Email Draft with Agent**
  - Use the 'User Input' tool to present the draft email to the agent and ask if they are OK with it or would like to make changes.
  - If changes are requested, use the 'Content Analysis' tool to revise the draft and repeat this step until the agent approves.

- **Step 8: Confirm Email Draft with User**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to display the updated email draft to the user.
  - Use the 'User Input' tool to ask the user to confirm if the email draft is acceptable for use.
  - Do not proceed until the user confirms the draft is OK.

- **Step 9: Record Validation Comparison in Work Notes**
  - Use the 'Update Case with Validation Results' tool to write the markdown-formatted comparison (from Step 4) into the work notes of the case.
  - Provide the 'case' reference and the 'validationsummary' as inputs.

- **Step 10: Create Validation Task for Assigned Agent**
  - Use the 'Create Validation Task' tool to create a task for the assigned agent.
  - Include the human-readable summary of the validation issues in the 'validationsummary' input and the relevant 'casenumber'.

- **Step 11: Send Email Notification**
  - Use the 'Email Notification' tool to send the approved email draft to both the assigned agent and the requestor for this onboarding.
  - Provide the 'emaildraft1' (the approved draft) and the 'case' reference as inputs.

- **Step 12: Handle Unexpected Scenarios**
  - If at any point a tool fails, returns an error, or the scenario is not covered by the instructions or available tools, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user of the issue.
  - If the problem cannot be resolved or is outside the scope of the available tools, proceed to the next step.

- **Step 13: Completion**
  - Once all steps are completed and the mission is achieved, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution.
