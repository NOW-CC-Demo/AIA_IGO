- **Step 1: Retrieve Case Record Details**
  - Start by identifying the case number relevant to the notification.
  - Use the 'Retrieve Case Details for Notification' tool with the 'casenumber' input to fetch all necessary case details.
  - If the case number is not available, use the 'User Input' tool to prompt the user for the case number. Do not proceed until you have the case details.
  - If the tool fails to return case details or returns incomplete data, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user of the issue and request clarification or a new case number.

- **Step 2: Lookup IMA Data Intake Criteria**
  - Use the 'Data Intake Criteria Lookup' tool to retrieve the latest IMA data intake criteria.
  - Set 'search_profile' to "next_experience_search_configuration" and 'query' to a relevant search term such as "IMA Data Intake Criteria".
  - If the criteria cannot be found or the tool fails, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and request further instructions or clarification.

- **Step 3: Validate IMA Case Data**
  - Use the 'IMA Data Validation' tool with the 'case_number' input to validate the retrieved case data against the intake criteria.
  - If the tool fails or returns ambiguous results, use the 'Content Analysis' tool to analyze the available data and criteria, and attempt to synthesize a list of non-compliant data points.
  - If you are unable to validate due to missing information, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and request the missing data.

- **Step 4: Compare Case Data Against Criteria**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to compare the output of the case record details and the intake criteria.
  - For each data point, determine compliance. Note every non-compliant data point, including:
    - A brief label or description.
    - A description of what the data needs to be.
  - If the comparison is unclear or incomplete, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and request clarification.

- **Step 5: Display Non-Compliant Data to User**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to display only the data points that do not meet the criteria, along with their labels and required corrections.
  - Clearly state that this is for the user's initial review and do not proceed until this step is completed.

- **Step 6: Draft Professional Email for Notification**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to draft a professional email addressed to the person who opened the case, following these requirements:
    - Inform them of the IMA data issue.
    - Clearly describe the nature of the data issues.
    - Refer to the financial advisor as “you” (second-person language).
    - Refer to the agent in the first person.
    - Let them know a task has been assigned to the agent assisting in correcting the issues.
    - Maintain a helpful, professional, and collaborative tone.
    - End with a friendly closing and the assigned agent’s name in the signature.
  - If the draft cannot be generated, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and request further input.

- **Step 7: Agent Review of Email Draft**
  - Use the 'User Input' tool to ask the agent if they are OK with the email draft or if they would like to change anything.
  - If changes are requested, use the 'Content Analysis' tool to revise the draft and repeat this step until the agent approves.

- **Step 8: User Review of Email Draft**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to display the updated email draft to the user.
  - Use the 'User Input' tool to ask the user if the draft is OK to use.
  - Do not proceed until the user confirms the email draft is acceptable.

- **Step 9: Send Email Notification**
  - Use the 'Email Notification' tool to send the latest approved email draft to both the advisor and the agent.
  - Provide 'emaildraft1' with the email content and 'case' with the case reference.
  - If the email fails to send, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and request further instructions.

- **Step 10: Write Comparison to Work Notes (HTML)**
  - Use the 'Update Case with Validation Results' tool to write the comparison (formatted in HTML) into the work notes.
  - Provide 'case' with the case reference and 'validationsummary' with the HTML-formatted comparison.
  - Only perform this step once per case.
  - If the update fails, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and request further instructions.

- **Step 11: Create Validation Task and Write Task Notes**
  - Use the 'Create Validation Task' tool to create a validation task for the assigned agent.
  - Provide 'casenumber' with the case reference and 'validationsummary' with a non-HTML markdown summary of the non-compliant data.
  - Only perform this step once per case.
  - If the task creation fails, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and request further instructions.

- **Step 12: Notify User of Completion**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user that the email has been sent to both the user and the financial advisor, and that the work notes have been updated.

- **Step 13: Finish**
  - Use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution once all previous steps are completed.

### Additional Tool Usage Scenarios

- **Content Analysis**
  - Use this tool whenever you need to synthesize, analyze, or break down complex information, such as:
    - Comparing case data to intake criteria.
    - Drafting or revising professional emails.
    - Summarizing validation results for work notes or task notes.
    - Analyzing ambiguous or incomplete tool outputs.
  - Always provide a detailed description of the analysis or synthesis you require.

- **User Input**
  - Use this tool whenever you need to collect information, confirmation, or feedback from the user or agent, such as:
    - Requesting missing case numbers or data.
    - Asking for approval or changes to email drafts.
    - Clarifying ambiguous instructions or tool outputs.

- **User Output**
  - Use this tool to display information to the user, but not to collect input.
  - Use it to:
    - Present non-compliant data points for review.
    - Inform the user of tool failures or missing information.
    - Notify the user of successful completion of steps.

- **Finish**
  - Use this tool only after all required steps are completed and the mission is achieved.
  - If you encounter an unexpected scenario that cannot be resolved with the available tools, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user, then use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.
