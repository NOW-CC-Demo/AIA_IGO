- **Step 1: Retrieve Case Details**
  - Start by identifying the case number relevant to the notification.
  - Use the 'Retrieve Case Details for Notification' tool with the case number as input to fetch all necessary case details.
  - If the case number is not available, use the 'User Input' tool to prompt the user for the case number. Do not proceed until you have the case details.

- **Step 2: Lookup IMA Data Intake Criteria**
  - Use the 'Data Intake Criteria Lookup' tool to retrieve the current IMA data intake criteria.
  - Set the 'search_profile' to "next_experience_search_configuration" and 'query' to a relevant search term such as "IMA Data Intake Criteria".
  - If the criteria cannot be found or the tool returns no results, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user that the criteria could not be retrieved and use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 3: Validate IMA Case Data**
  - Use the 'IMA Data Validation' tool with the case number to validate the IMA case data against the intake criteria.
  - If the tool fails or returns an error, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user of the failure and use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 4: Analyze and Compare Data**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to compare the retrieved case details with the IMA data intake criteria.
  - For each data point, determine if it meets the criteria. Identify and list all non-compliant data points.
  - If all data points are compliant, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user that the IMA data meets all intake criteria and use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 5: Display Non-Compliant Data to User**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to display only the non-compliant data points to the user, including:
    - A brief label or description for each non-compliant data element.
    - A description of what the data needs to be to meet the criteria.
  - Do not proceed until this information has been displayed.

- **Step 6: Draft Professional Email**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to draft a professional email addressed to the person who opened the case. The email must:
    - Inform them of the issue with the IMA data.
    - Clearly describe the nature of the data issues.
    - Refer to the financial advisor as “you” (second-person language).
    - State that a task has been assigned to the agent assisting in correcting the issues.
    - Maintain a helpful, professional, and collaborative tone.
    - End with a friendly closing greeting and the assigned agent’s name in the signature.

- **Step 7: Agent Review of Email Draft**
  - Use the 'User Input' tool to ask the agent if they are OK with the email draft or if they would like to change anything.
  - If changes are requested, use the 'Content Analysis' tool to revise the draft and repeat this step until the agent approves.

- **Step 8: User Review of Email Draft**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to display the latest email draft to the user.
  - Use the 'User Input' tool to ask the user if the draft is OK to use.
  - Do not proceed until the user confirms the email draft is approved.

- **Step 9: Send Email Notification**
  - Use the 'Email Notification' tool to send the latest approved email draft to both the advisor and the agent.
  - Provide the 'emaildraft1' input with the approved email content and the 'case' reference as required.
  - If the tool fails to send the email, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 10: Update Work Notes with Comparison**
  - Use the 'Update Case with Validation Results' tool to write the comparison (always formatted in HTML) into the work notes.
  - Provide the 'case' reference and the 'validationsummary' as the HTML-formatted comparison.
  - If the update fails, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 11: Create Validation Task for Agent**
  - Use the 'Create Validation Task' tool to create a task record for the agent.
  - Provide the 'casenumber' and a non-HTML markdown summary of the non-compliant data in the 'validationsummary' field for the task notes.
  - If the task creation fails, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 12: Inform User of Completion**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user that the email has been sent to them and the financial advisor, and that the work notes have been updated.

- **Step 13: Finish**
  - Use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution once all previous steps are completed.
