- **Step 1: Retrieve Advisor Information**
  - Begin by leveraging the 'Advisor Knowledge Graph' tool to retrieve advisor information for the currently logged-in user.
  - Use the following inputs for the tool:
    - `query`: Formulate a direct query to retrieve advisor information for the logged-in user. For example, "Retrieve advisor information for the current user."
    - `knowledge_graph`: Use the value `47152d542b9e2a50c246fb466e91bf0e` as the knowledge graph source.
    - `show_column_properties`: Set this to `true` to include column properties in the output.
    - `group_by_table`: Set this to `true` to group the results by table.
  - If the tool successfully retrieves the advisor information, proceed to the next step.
  - If the tool fails or returns an unexpected result, use the 'Content Analysis' tool to analyze the issue and determine the next course of action. Provide the following input:
    - `analysis`: Describe the issue encountered with the 'Advisor Knowledge Graph' tool and analyze potential reasons for failure.

- **Step 2: Display Advisor Information**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to display the retrieved advisor information to the user in a markdown format.
  - Provide the following input:
    - `message`: Format the advisor information into a clear and readable markdown structure. For example:
      ```
      ### Advisor Information
      - **Name**: [Advisor Name]
      - **Firm**: [Firm Name]
      - **Contact**: [Contact Details]
      ```
    - `references`: If applicable, include citations or references to the original source of the information.

- **Step 3: Confirm with the User**
  - Use the 'User Input' tool to ask the user for confirmation on the displayed information.
  - Provide the following input:
    - `promptMessage`: "Does this look right?"

- **Step 4: Handle User Feedback**
  - If the user confirms that the information is correct, proceed to the next step.
  - If the user indicates that the information is incorrect or incomplete:
    - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to analyze the feedback and determine the issue. Provide the following input:
      - `analysis`: Include the user's feedback and the retrieved advisor information to identify discrepancies or missing details.
    - Based on the analysis, refine the query and re-execute the 'Advisor Knowledge Graph' tool to retrieve updated information. Repeat Steps 1 to 3 as necessary.

- **Step 5: Completion**
  - Once the user confirms that the information is correct, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution.
