- **Step 1: Analyze the Mission and Requirements**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to synthesize and break down the mission: "Create a new investor suitability record."
  - In your analysis, consider what information is required, what is missing, and what steps are necessary to fulfill the mission.
  - If the mission or requirements are unclear, ambiguous, or missing details, use this tool to clarify your own understanding and plan the next steps.

- **Step 2: Gather Required User Input**
  - Review the inputs required by the 'Investor Suitability Record Producer' tool. The only input is 'tax_exemp0' (Is the account tax exempt?), which is optional.
  - If you do not have enough information to proceed (for example, if you do not know whether the account is tax exempt), use the 'User Input' tool to prompt the user for this information.
    - Example prompt: "Is the account tax exempt? Please answer yes or no."
  - Wait for the user's response before proceeding.

- **Step 3: Create the Investor Suitability Record**
  - Once you have the necessary information (including the value for 'tax_exemp0', if provided by the user), use the 'Investor Suitability Record Producer' tool to create the new investor suitability record.
    - Input the value for 'tax_exemp0' as obtained from the user, or leave it blank if the user did not provide it and it is not mandatory.
  - Monitor the tool's output for success or failure.

- **Step 4: Handle Success and Failure Scenarios**
  - If the 'Investor Suitability Record Producer' tool successfully creates the record, proceed to the next step.
  - If the tool fails or returns an unexpected result:
    - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to analyze the error or unexpected output.
    - If the issue can be resolved by clarifying or correcting the input, return to Step 2 to gather the correct information from the user.
    - If the issue cannot be resolved or is outside the scope of your tools, proceed to Step 6 to finish.

- **Step 5: Inform the User of the Outcome**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user that the investor suitability record has been created.
    - Do not ask any questions in this message; only provide information about the successful creation.
    - If applicable, include any relevant details or references as provided by the 'Investor Suitability Record Producer' tool.

- **Step 6: Completion**
  - Use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution once the mission has been achieved or if you encounter an unresolvable issue.
