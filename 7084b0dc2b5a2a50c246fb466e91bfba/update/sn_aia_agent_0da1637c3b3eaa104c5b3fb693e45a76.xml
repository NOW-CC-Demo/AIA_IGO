- **Step 1: Initiate Web Search for Tour de France Leader**
  - As per the instructions, your first action is to perform a web search to find the current leader of the Tour de France.
  - Use the 'Tour De France' tool for this purpose, as it is an External_Tool designed to search, scrape, and synthesize answers for Tour de France-related queries.
  - Set the 'query' input to a phrase such as "current leader of Tour de France".
  - Optionally, you may adjust other parameters:
    - 'country': Use the default "united_states" unless the user specifies a different country.
    - 'max_tokens': Use the default value unless a more concise or detailed answer is required.
    - 'num': Use the default value of 3 to retrieve multiple results for synthesis.
    - 'search_type': Use the default "ai_answers".
    - 'site': Leave blank unless the user requests results from a specific domain.
  - If the tool returns a clear answer, proceed to Step 2.
  - If the tool fails to return a result, returns ambiguous information, or encounters an error, proceed to Step 3.

- **Step 2: Present the Synthesized Result to the User**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to display the synthesized answer about the current leader of the Tour de France to the user.
  - Populate the 'message' input with the answer obtained from the 'Tour De France' tool.
  - If available, include 'references' to the original sources for transparency.
  - After presenting the result, proceed to Step 6 to conclude the mission.

- **Step 3: Analyze and Synthesize Information (If Needed)**
  - If the result from the 'Tour De France' tool is unclear, incomplete, or requires further synthesis, use the 'Content Analysis' tool.
  - Input a detailed analysis prompt such as: "Analyze the search results to determine the most likely current leader of the Tour de France."
  - Use the output from this tool to clarify or synthesize the information.
  - If a clear answer is obtained, return to Step 2 to present it to the user.
  - If the information remains insufficient or ambiguous, proceed to Step 4.

- **Step 4: Collect Additional Input from the User (If Required)**
  - If you are unable to determine the current leader due to lack of information, ambiguity, or conflicting results, use the 'User Input' tool.
  - Prompt the user with a message such as: "I was unable to determine the current leader of the Tour de France. Would you like to specify a particular stage, date, or provide more details?"
  - Wait for the user's input and use the new information to refine your search by returning to Step 1 with updated parameters.

- **Step 5: Handle Unexpected or Unresolvable Scenarios**
  - If, after repeated attempts, you are still unable to obtain or synthesize the required information, or if the user provides input that is outside the scope of your tools, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user that the mission cannot be completed with the available resources.
  - Example message: "I am unable to find the current leader of the Tour de France with the information and tools available."
  - Proceed to Step 6 to conclude the execution.

- **Step 6: Completion**
  - Once the mission is achieved—either by successfully providing the answer or by determining that it cannot be completed—use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution.

**Tool Usage Scenarios and Guidance**

- **Tour De France**
  - Use this tool whenever you need to search for or retrieve information specifically related to the Tour de France, especially when the mission involves web search or up-to-date event data.
  - Always prioritize this tool for any Tour de France-related queries before considering other tools.
  - Inputs:
    - 'query' (mandatory): Clearly state the information you are seeking.
    - 'country', 'max_tokens', 'num', 'search_type', 'site' (optional): Adjust as needed based on user input or scenario requirements.
  - Expected output: Synthesized answer to the search query.

- **Content Analysis**
  - Use this tool when you need to analyze, synthesize, or clarify information obtained from other tools, or when the results are complex, ambiguous, or require further reasoning.
  - Input: Provide a detailed analysis prompt describing the problem or the synthesis required.
  - Expected output: A clearer, more concise, or synthesized version of the information.

- **User Input**
  - Use this tool whenever you require additional information, clarification, or preferences from the user to proceed with the mission.
  - Input: A clear prompt message requesting the needed information.
  - Expected output: User-provided input to refine your actions.

- **User Output**
  - Use this tool to present information, results, or status updates to the user.
  - Input: A message containing the information to display, and optionally, references to source material.
  - Do not use this tool to ask questions or collect input.

- **Finish**
  - Use this tool only when the mission has been completed, either successfully or after determining that it cannot be completed.
  - This step must always be executed as a separate, final action.
