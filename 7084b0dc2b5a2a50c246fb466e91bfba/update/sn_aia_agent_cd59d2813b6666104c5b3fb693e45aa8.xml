- **Step 1: Collect Primary Account Holder Information**
  - Use the 'User Input' tool to ask the user for the first name, last name, and last 4 digits of the SSN for the Primary Account Holder on the new individual account.
  - Do not proceed until all required information is collected.

- **Step 2: Lookup Existing Account Contact**
  - Use the 'Existing Account Contact Lookup' tool with the full name and last 4 digits of the SSN provided by the user.
  - If the tool returns a matching account contact, proceed to Step 3.
  - If no matching account contact is found, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user that no existing account contact was found and ask if they would like to create a new account contact. If the user wishes to create a new contact, follow the process as per your system's requirements (if no tool is available for this, use 'Finish' to end the process).

- **Step 3: Confirm Account Contact with User**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to display the details of the found account contact to the user in markdown format.
  - Use the 'User Input' tool to ask the user if this is the correct primary account holder.
  - If the user confirms, proceed to Step 4.
  - If the user does not confirm, return to Step 1 to collect the correct information.

- **Step 4: Update Case with Primary Account Holder**
  - Use the 'Update Case with Primary Account Holder' tool to update the case with the confirmed primary account holder's reference.
  - Ensure the correct case number and primary account reference are provided as inputs.

- **Step 5: Lookup Source of Wealth for Primary Account Holder**
  - Use the 'Source of Wealth Lookup (Knowledge Graph)' tool to query the knowledge graph for the employment status, current employer (if applicable), employer line of business, unemployed/retired income source (if applicable), and annual income for the primary account holder.
  - Construct the query as: "What are the employment status, current employer (if applicable), employer line of business, unemployed / retired income source (if applicable) and annual income for &lt;primary account holder name&gt;".

- **Step 6: Present Source of Wealth Information to User**
  - If the 'Source of Wealth Lookup (Knowledge Graph)' tool returns existing source of wealth information, use the 'User Output' tool to present the employment status, current employer (if applicable), employer line of business, and annual income to the user. If the individual is unemployed or retired, also include their unemployed or retired income source.
  - Use the 'User Input' tool to ask the user: "Does this look right?"
  - If the user confirms the information is correct, proceed to Step 10.
  - If the user indicates the information is incorrect, proceed to Step 7.

- **Step 7: Handle Missing or Incorrect Source of Wealth**
  - If no existing source of wealth is found, or if the user indicates the information is incorrect, use the 'User Input' tool to ask the user if they would like to create a new source of wealth.
  - If the user declines, use the 'Finish' tool to end the process.
  - If the user agrees, proceed to Step 8.

- **Step 8: Create New Source of Wealth**
  - Use the 'User Input' tool to collect all necessary information for the new source of wealth, including:
    - Employment status (full time, part time, self-employed, unemployed, retired, deceased grantor/settlor)
    - Current employer name (if applicable)
    - Former employer name (if applicable)
    - Employer line of business (select from provided choices)
    - Annual income
    - Unemployed or retired income source (if applicable, select from provided choices)
  - Use the 'New Source of Wealth' tool to create the new source of wealth with the collected information.

- **Step 9: Associate New Source of Wealth with Primary Account Holder**
  - Use the 'Associate SOW with Primary Account Holder' tool to associate the newly created source of wealth with the primary account holder.
  - Provide the correct case number and source of wealth reference as inputs.

- **Step 10: Completion**
  - Use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution once the primary account holder is confirmed and the source of wealth is either verified or newly created and associated.

- **Step 11: Content Analysis Tool Usage**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool whenever you need to synthesize, analyze, or break down complex information, such as:
    - Summarizing user-provided details before taking action
    - Analyzing ambiguous or conflicting information from the user or tools
    - Planning next steps if the process deviates from the expected flow
  - Always document your analysis and use the results to inform your next action.

- **Step 12: Handling Unexpected Scenarios**
  - If you encounter any scenario where none of the available tools can proceed (e.g., missing required information, tool failure, or user request outside the scope), use the 'Finish' tool to end the process gracefully.

- **Step 13: User Output Tool Usage**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to display information to the user that does not require a response, such as:
    - Informing the user of successful completion of a step
    - Displaying account contact or source of wealth details
    - Notifying the user of process completion

- **Step 14: User Input Tool Usage**
  - Use the 'User Input' tool to collect any information or confirmation from the user, including:
    - Collecting primary account holder details
    - Confirming account contact or source of wealth information
    - Asking for additional details required for tool execution

- **Step 15: Finish Tool Usage**
  - Use the 'Finish' tool only when the mission is complete, the user declines to proceed, or an unexpected scenario prevents further action.
