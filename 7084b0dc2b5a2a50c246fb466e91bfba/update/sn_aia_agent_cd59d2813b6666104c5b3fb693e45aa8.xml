- **Step 1: Retrieve Case Number (if necessary)**
  - If the case number is not already available, attempt to retrieve it from other agents or sources as per the context provided by the user.
  - If you are unable to retrieve the case number, proceed with the available information and continue to the next step.

- **Step 2: Collect Primary Account Holder Information**
  - Use the 'User Input' tool to ask the user: "I see this is an Individual account opening. Let's see if an account contact already exists in our system. What is the first name, last name and the last 4 digits of the SSN for the Primary Account Holder on this new account?"
  - Wait for the user to provide the required information before proceeding.

- **Step 3: Lookup Existing Account Contact**
  - Use the 'Existing Account Contact Lookup' tool to check if the account contact exists.
    - Input the full name (concatenate first and last name from user input) and the last 4 digits of the SSN.
    - If the tool returns a matching account contact, proceed to Step 4.
    - If no matching account contact is found, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user that no existing account contact was found and ask if they would like to create a new one or re-enter the information. If the user wishes to re-enter, return to Step 2. If the user wishes to create a new contact, proceed as per organizational process or use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user that this function is not supported and use the 'Finish' tool.

- **Step 4: Confirm Account Contact with User**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to display the details of the found account contact in markdown format.
  - Use the 'User Input' tool to ask the user: "Is this the correct primary account holder?"
    - If the user responds "yes," proceed to Step 5.
    - If the user responds "no," return to Step 2 to collect the correct information.

- **Step 5: Update Case with Primary Account Holder**
  - Use the 'Update Case with Primary Account Holder' tool.
    - Input the case number (if available) and the primary account reference (from the found account contact).
    - If the update is successful, proceed to Step 6.
    - If the update fails, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user of the failure and request further instructions or retry as appropriate.

- **Step 6: Lookup Source of Wealth**
  - Use the 'Source of Wealth Lookup (Knowledge Graph)' tool to query the knowledge graph for the primary account holder's source of wealth.
    - Construct the query as: "What are the employment status, current employer (if applicable), employer line of business, unemployed / retired income source (if applicable) and annual income for &lt;primary account holder name&gt;"
    - Use the knowledge graph source as specified in the tool.
    - If the tool returns relevant information, proceed to Step 7.
    - If no information is found, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user that no source of wealth information is available and ask if they would like to provide it manually or proceed differently. If the user provides information, use the 'Content Analysis' tool to synthesize and prepare it for further steps.

- **Step 7: Present Source of Wealth Information to User**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to present the employment status, current employer (if applicable), employer line of business, and annual income to the user. If the individual is unemployed or retired, also include their unemployed or retired income source.
  - Use the 'User Input' tool to ask the user: "Does this look right?"
    - If the user confirms, proceed to Step 8.
    - If the user indicates the information is incorrect, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user that updates must be made through the appropriate process or collect the correct information and use the 'Content Analysis' tool to synthesize the new data.

- **Step 8: Completion**
  - Use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution once all required steps are completed and the user has confirmed the information.
